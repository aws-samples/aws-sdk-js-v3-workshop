# aws-sdk-js-v3-workshop

In this workshop, we're going to:

- Build a simple note taking application
- Identify the benefits of using AWS JS SDK v3 over v2

The note taking application is the modified version from the original Open Source MIT licensed project shared in the tutorials on [serverless-stack](http://serverless-stack.com).

## Pre-requisites

To set up this workshop package, complete the following tasks:

- Install **Node.js** by following these steps:
  1. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update)
  1. Install node v10.0.0 by running `nvm install 10` and `nvm use 10` in a terminal window
  1. Verify that node is installed by running `node -v` in a terminal window and confirm that it shows the latest version of `v10`, such as `v10.16.3`)
- Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
  - We recommend using **yarn** for its simplicity and speed. Although you can still use npm's cli instead of yarn,
    we do not provide alternative instructions for using npm' cli instead of yarn in this workshop
- If you don't have an AWS account, [create one](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)
  - If you're an Amazon employee, see the internal wiki for creating an AWS account
- Install the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
  - Verify that the AWS CLI is installed by running `aws` in a terminal window
- Install the [AWS SAM CLI and Docker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
  - Verify that the AWS SAM CLI is installed by running `sam` in a terminal window
- Set up [AWS Shared Credential File](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
  - Your `~/.aws/credentials` (`%UserProfile%\.aws\credentials` on Windows) should look like the following:
    ```
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = <ACCESS_KEY>
    aws_secret_access_key = <SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
    ```
  - Your `~/.aws/config` (`%UserProfile%\.aws\config` on Windows) should look like the following:
    ```
    [default]
    region = us-west-2
    ```

## Exercise1

This exercise code uses AWS SDK JS v2 as follows:

- backend performs create, delete, get, list and update operations on DynamoDB
- frontend does put, get, delete operations using an S3 browser client

The README files have instructions on how to move it to v3

### Backend

Perform the following steps to create the backend API:

- `cd Exercise1/backend`
- Follow [backend README](./Exercise1/backend/README.md)

Remember to test your backend code before the next step.

### FrontEnd

Perform the following steps to run the frontend:

- `cd Exercise1/frontend`
- Follow [frontend README](./Exercise1/frontend/README.md)

## Exercise2

This exercise has the code which uses AWS JS SDK v3, which you would have got after finishing Exercise1:

- backend performs create, delete, get, list and update operations on DynamoDB
- frontend does put, get, delete operations using an S3 browser client

The README files have suggestions on how you can use the AWS service you're familiar with in v3

### Backend

Perform the following steps to create the backend API:

- `cd Exercise2/backend`
- Follow [backend README](./Exercise2/backend/README.md)

Remember to test your backend code before the next step.

### FrontEnd

Perform the following steps to run the frontend:

- `cd Exercise2/frontend`
- Follow [frontend README](./Exercise2/frontend/README.md)

# Exercise3

Inspect the differences of stack trace if call `DynamoDB.putItem` with invalid resources
in V2 and V3 SDK.
